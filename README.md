## Overview
This project is an interactive 3D Product Viewer built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Users can explore a product (a chair, built from basic geometries) with both manual mouse controls and automatic camera rotation. The viewer demonstrates foundational computer graphics concepts: scene setup, mesh composition, lighting, raycasting, animation, and camera controls.

## Features
- **Scene Setup:** Perspective camera, WebGL renderer, and responsive canvas.
- **3D Product:** A chair built from boxes and cylinders, centered at the origin.
- **Lighting:** Ambient and directional lighting for realistic shading.
- **Mouse Interaction:**
  - Hover to highlight parts and see their name.
  - Click to briefly change color and show part name.
- **Camera Animation:**
  - Automatic rotation around the product.
  - User mouse controls (orbit, pan, zoom) pause auto-rotation.
- **No Build Tools Needed:** Works by simply opening `index.html` in your browser.

## How to Run
1. **Download or clone this repository.**
2. **Open the `3d-product-viewer` folder.**
3. **Double-click `index.html`** (or right-click and choose "Open with" â†’ your browser).
   - _No npm, no server, no build tools required._
   - _No CI/CD, npx, or Vite required._

## File Structure
